*   **Chain** - This entity is a decorative chain that can be attached to moving or static solids, or not. If both ends are not attached, the chain will immediately disappear. The _"extraJoints"_ option will allow you to make the chain longer without changing the distance between the two ends.
*   **Chained Falling Block** - This is a regular falling block that will be restrained to fall a maximum distance, specified by the _"fallDistance"_ parameter. The block is visually held by two chains, however you can set it to one chain by ticking on _"centeredChain"_ option, and the _"chainOutline"_ option will let you set whether the chains should have a black outline. There is an indicator that will appear as a black, transparent rectangle covering the area that the block will be able to fall in, and show where it'll stop. You can turn it off by disabling _"indicator"_. If you wish the indicator to be visible before the block is triggered, enable _"indicatorAtStart"_. **Dream Falling Blocks** also support this mechanic.
*   **Chained Kevin** - This is a one-sided kevin that is constrained to travel a maximum distance, specified by the _"chainLength"_ parameter. This Kevin can only travel in one direction. Like **Chained Falling Blocks**, you can also use the _"chainOutline"_ and _"centeredChain"_ options.
