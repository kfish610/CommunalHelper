*   **Cassette Zip Mover**, **Move Block**, **Swap Block** and **Falling Block** - Similar to the dream block types above, each of these entities take the movement behaviour of a specific solid, and apply it to a cassette block. **Cassette Zip Mover** and **Swap Block** both have access to _"no return"_ mode. **Dream Zip Mover** has additional _"ticking"_, _"permanent"_ and _"waiting"_ modes. Since 1.8.0, all of these types, and a new **Custom Cassette Block** include a _"customColor"_ option, which is an hexadecimal color code.
