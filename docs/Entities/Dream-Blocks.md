*   **Dream Zip Mover**, **Move Block**, **Swap Block**, **Falling Block,** **Switch Gate**, **Crumble Block** and **Floaty Space Block** - As the name suggests, each of these entities take the movement behaviour of a specific solid, and apply it to a dream block. These entities all have access to the same _"feather mode"_, _"refill count"_ and _"one use"_ options as the **Connected Dream Block**. **Dream Zip Mover** and **Swap Block** both have access to _"no return"_ mode. **Dream Zip Mover** has additional _"ticking"_, _"permanent"_ and _"waiting"_ modes. **Dream Move Block** and **Falling Block** have access to the _"no collide"_ mode, which will allow them to pass through any solids other than Dream Blocks while moving. **Dream Flag Switch Gates** are a thing after being requested, they require [max480's Helping Hand](https://gamebanana.com/gamefiles/11423) to appear in the Ahorn placement list. On 1.9.3, the "_quickDestroy_" option was added by @vitellary#1950.
